I also added a build in command jobs to display all the jobs.

Job.h / Job.c

	       -- contains a structure to hold information about jobs.
      	       -- This also has method to both allocate the structure
      	       -- as well as free it. printJobs was a debugging tool.


List.h / List.c 

      	       -- This is an array list implementation that dynamically
      	       -- resizes itself as needed. 


LList.h / LList.c 

      	       -- This is an linked list implementation that contains
      	       -- methods to access it's elements.

util.h / util.c 

      	       -- This contains most of the unistd function calls that
      	       -- are made such as executebg and executefg.

wait.c
      	       -- This was a test program so I could test background processes
